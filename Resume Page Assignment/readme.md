This is Resume Landing Page assignment.
First I set up the github repository, then on my laptop I cloned it using git clone command.
Then I created index.html file and wrote HTML code for the landing page, used HTML elements like header, section, main, footer, table, heading, paragraphs, strong etc.
Then I used git commands like git add, commit, and push.
This pushed the assignment to github repo.
