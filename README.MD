# Web Development Practice Projects 🚀

This repository contains my **HTML practice assignments and projects**, created as part of my web development learning journey.  
Each project is placed in a separate folder and is accessible via a single main index page.

The goal of this repository is to:
- practice clean code
- understand core web concepts
- maintain an organized, scalable structure
- showcase assignments in a simple, accessible way
